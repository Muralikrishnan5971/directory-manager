# directory-manager
This is a python project for managing directory content.

## Steps to use this project
1. clone the project to your local --> ```git clone "repo url"```
2. navigate to the project --> ```cd directory-manager```
3. create a python virtual environment --> ```python3 -m venv env```
4. activate your virtual environment --> ```source env/bin/activate``
5. install all your dependencies, in our case which is only the watchdog module.
6. use ```pip install watchdog``` or ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
7. In main.py, change all source and destination directory paths based on your requirements,
8. add all extensions that need to be monitored to the extension dictionary.
9. run ```python3 main.py```
10. Voila, python takes care of your Downloads directory and you can customize the project to watch and manage any specified directory just by changing the source path.
